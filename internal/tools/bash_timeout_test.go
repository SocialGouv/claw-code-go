// TestExecuteBashKillsOrphanGrandchild guards against the hang where a

// after the timeout SIGKILL, and keeps the pipes open — wedging
// cmd.Wait() forever. The Setpgid + cmd.Cancel + WaitDelay combo must
// bring ExecuteBash back well under the 32s budget.

// The command spawns a bash that backgrounds a long-sleeping child
// inheriting stdout, then sleeps long enough to outlast the 30s bash
// timeout if the orphan held the pipe open. Without the fix this test
// would hang past `time` 60s. With the fix it returns inside ~32s
